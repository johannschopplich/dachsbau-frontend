# Dachsbau Frontend

Frontend for [Dachsbau Tautenhain](https://dachsbau-tautenhain.de). The backend code can be found [on GitHub as well](https://github.com/johannschopplich/dachsbau-backend).

This repository uses Nuxt 3 for the frontend and fetches content from a [headless Kirby](https://github.com/johannschopplich/kirby-headless-starter) instance. The frontend is built upon the [kirby-nuxt-starterkit](https://github.com/johannschopplich/kirby-nuxt-starterkit).

This website was created for one of my best friends to help her with her new venture of starting her own business. I created [`nuxt-kql`](https://nuxt-kql.jhnn.dev) in the process, since I really wanted to try out Kirby in a headless environment.

All illustrations are drawn by the talented artist [Julia Frank](https://www.instagram.com/mum.mal.mini/).
